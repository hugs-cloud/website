  HUb for greenhouse Gas data Science
---
HUGS is a cloud-based data analysis "hub" for greenhouse gas measurements, modelling and data analysis, funded as a NERC ["Constructing a Digital Environment"](https://nerc.ukri.org/innovation/activities/environmentaldata/digitalenv/) feasibility study. We aim to streamline the process for data sharing, analysis and visualisation and add value through automated processes such as atmospheric chemistry transport model runs associated with uploaded data.

## Challenges

Current challenges when dealing with greenhouse gas data include
- a wide and diverse range of measurements spanning a range of scales
- a range of non-standard formats leading in difficulty to inter-compare datasets
- institutional firewalls forming a barrier to sharing of data
- data analysis typically only carried out on a case-by-case basis

## Solutions

The HUGS platform aims to solve these challenges by providing a platform for intercomparing measurement data. It will allow automatic comparison of data with simulation results and feature comprehensive data analysis tools and functionality. We do not plan on creating another data repository, we want HUGS to be a platform that facilitates sharing of greenhouse gas data between scientists.

## Interface

Interaction with the data and associated products to plot and interpret will be facilitated via a simple web interface with more functionality available via Jupyter notebooks.

## Visualisation

HUGS will allow users to run complex simulations on demand, allowing creation of striking visualisations that help transfer knowledge effectively.

## Prototype

To use a prototype of the platform please visit the [Registration]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link registration.md %}) page and submit your details. You will then be emailed a username and password to login to the [HUGS Hub](https://hub.hugs-cloud.com) that allows interaction with the HUGS platform through a simple
Jupyter Notebook interface.

To participate or for more information please contact [Dr. Matt Rigby](mailto:matt.rigby@bristol.ac.uk).
